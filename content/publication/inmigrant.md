abstract = "Adequate birth intervals are considered a positive factor in the health of mothers and their children. One of the objectives of this study is to compare the birth interval between Nicaraguan immigrant women and local mothers in Costa Rica. Birth intervals among Nicaraguan women are significantly shorter than the local ones (p < 0.001). Half of the children of the Nicaraguan mothers have birth intervals of a minimum of 335 days (less than one year). Half of the local children have birth intervals of a minimum of 881 days (2.4 years)."
